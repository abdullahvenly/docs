## What is ISAE 3000?

ISAE 3000 is an internationally recognized standard that focuses on internal controls, sustainability, and compliance with laws and regulations. It ensures that organizations manage their information systems and data processing processes rigorously. To achieve this, they must establish appropriate internal control (COSO) procedures for safe service provision and operation.

ISAE 3000 Type 2 certification is crucial. It's issued after independent audits evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls over a period.

## ISAE 3000 Certification for Blockchain Mainnets

Blockchain technology offers significant advantages in maintaining decentralized transaction records and protecting user privacy in a decentralized manner. However, ensuring the reliability of the blockchain network itself is essential to fully leverage these benefits. Obtaining ISAE 3000 certification indicates that the blockchain mainnet effectively manages security and stability in its services through effective internal controls.
