### [Digital Wallets](https://docs.venly.io/docs/wallet-api-overview)

Secure and scalable SSS-based wallets with robust key management custody digital assets. The Venly security protocol redefines private key security, never gathering a private key as one whole, eliminating risk. Venly customers use our wallets for a range of operations, such as treasury, trading, cold storage, royalties, NFTs, smart contracts, user wallets, and other digital assets.

### [Digital Assets](https://docs.venly.io/docs/nft-api-overview)

Robust tokenization is based on industry standards and is secured by several code and security audits. Our platform facilitates no-code and API solutions to manage, transfer, and gather information on different token asset classes, such as ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155, which our customers use in industries such as Finance, E-commerce, and Gaming.

### [Payments](https://docs.venly.io/docs/pay-api-overview)

With PAY, our platform offers a low-code payment integration that creates a customizable form for collecting payments. You can embed Pay directly on your website or redirect customers to a hosted payment page. It offers a wide range of payment methods, from credit cards to PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, instant bank transfers, and more, enabling customers to choose their preferred option.
